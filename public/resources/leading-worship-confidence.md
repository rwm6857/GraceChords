# Leading Worship with Confidence

Leading worship is a privilege and a challenge. Here are 3 essentials:

1. **Prepare spiritually** — private worship fuels public worship.  
2. **Practice intentionally** — know your songs and transitions.  
3. **Trust the Spirit** — confidence is found in God, not performance.  

> “Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord.” (Zechariah 4:6)
