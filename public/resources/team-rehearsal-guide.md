# Worship Team Rehearsal Guide

An effective rehearsal balances preparation with prayer.  

## Flow of a Good Rehearsal

- **Prayer (5 min)** — align hearts before playing.  
- **Run-through (20 min)** — play set start to finish.  
- **Breakdown (30 min)** — work transitions, intros, dynamics.  
- **Review (10 min)** — discuss and pray again.
