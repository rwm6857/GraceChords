Dear brother, do not be afraid 
Dear sister, be not in despair 
Let us pray to our Lord Jesus Christ 
Let us love our God with all our hearts

{start_of_chorus: Chorus 1}
In the Fatherâ€™s house, there are many rooms 
And he will prepare a place for me 
On that day, he will come and will take me for himself 
There is no more sorrow in my heart 

{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: Chorus 2}
I trust and look to you alone 
No matter what tribulation comes 
I  will    carry the cross and will follow you alone 
  Dm           E           F   G (Am) 
I will go out to all nations 
(Maranatha, come quickly Lord Jesus) 
{end_of_chorus}
