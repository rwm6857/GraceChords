{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[B]Your blood is healing ev’ry [G#m]wound
Your blood is making all things [E]new
Your blood speaks a better [B]word
[B]Your blood, the measure of my [G#m]worth
Your blood, more than I [E]deserve
Your blood speaks a better [G#m]word
Speaks a better [F#]word

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: Chorus}
It’s [B]singing out with life
It’s [G#m]shouting down the lies
It [E]echoes through the night
The precious blood of Christ
Speaks a [G#m]better word, speaks a [F#]better word

It’s [B]calling out my name
And it’s [G#m]breaking ev’ry chain
It’s [E]making all things right
The precious blood of Christ
Speaks a [F#]better word
Speaks a better word

{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[B]Your blood, a robe of [G#m]righteousness
Your blood, my hope and my [E]defense
Your blood forever covers [G#m]me
Oh, forever covers [F#]me

{end_of_verse}

It’s [E]rewriting my history
It [G#m]covers me with destiny
It’s [F#]making all things right
The [B]precious blood of Christ

{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_bridge: Outro}
[B]Whoah
[G#m]Whoah
Is [E]making all things right
The precious blood of Christ
Speaks a [F#]better word
Speaks a better word
