Verse
[A]This line is significantly longer than a typical lyric line and is meant to really stress the [E]wrapping behavior and ensure chords stay aligned over the correct characters while [D]text wraps across the column width gracefully without splitting sections
[A]Yet another extremely long lyrical phrase that [E]pushes the boundary of what can fit comfortably at larger sizes and should [D]trigger the two column plan or a size reduction when necessary

Bridge
[F#m]Sometimes the [D]words will go on and on [A]far beyond what we expected [E]but the sheet should still look clean

Chorus
[D]Hold it [A]steady [E]keep it [A]true
[D]Guide the [A]layout [E]all the [A]way through
