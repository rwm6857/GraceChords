Verse 1
The [G]Lord is my [D]light and my sal[Em]vation—whom shall I [C]fear
The [G]Lord is the [D]stronghold of my [Em]life—of whom shall I be [C]afraid
When [G]evildoers [D]came to de[Em]vour me, they stumbled and [C]fell
Though an [G]army en[D]camp against [Em]me, my heart shall not [C]fear

Verse 2
One [G]thing have I [D]asked of the [Em]Lord, that will I [C]seek
To [G]dwell in the [D]house of the [Em]Lord all the days of my [C]life
To [G]gaze upon [D]the beauty of the [Em]Lord and to in[C]quire in His temple
For [G]He will [D]hide me in His [Em]shelter in the day of [C]trouble

Chorus
I will [G]sing, I will [D]shout, I will [Em]lift up my head [C]high
For You [G]set me on a [D]rock, and my [Em]enemies fall be[C]low
Hear, O [G]Lord, when I [D]cry; be [Em]gracious and an[C]swer me
You have [G]said, “Seek My [D]face,” and my [Em]heart says, “Your [C]face I seek”

Verse 3
Hide [G]not Your [D]face from me, [Em]turn not away in [C]anger
You [G]have been my [D]help; [Em]cast me not off, for[C]sake me not
My [G]father and [D]mother may [Em]forsake me, but the [C]Lord will take me in
Teach me [G]Your way, O [D]Lord, [Em]lead me on a [C]level path

Verse 4
Give me [G]not up to the [D]will of my [Em]adversaries, for [C]false witnesses rise
They [G]breathe out [D]violence, yet [Em]I shall be con[C]fident
I be[G]lieve that I shall [D]look upon the [Em]goodness of the [C]Lord
In the [G]land of the [D]living—be [Em]strong and wait for the [C]Lord

Bridge
Wait for the [G]Lord; be [D]strong; let your [Em]heart take [C]courage
Wait for the [G]Lord; be [D]strong; let your [Em]heart take [C]courage
Wait for the [G]Lord; be [D]strong; let your [Em]heart take [C]courage
I will [G]wait for [D]You; my [Em]God, I’ll [C]wait for You
