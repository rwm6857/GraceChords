{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Jesus you walked on a lonely road, you bore every sin and shame	
How you shed your blood upon the cross, down that path I also will go

Though suffering comes I will follow you	
Through seas and mountains I will follow you	
For the lost and broken to return, I will gladly lay down my life	

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: Chorus 1}
Father God, I cry: â€œWould you send me? 	
I will run to where you lead	
My whole life I give it all to you	
Would you send me, my Lord	

{end_of_chorus}

Though this world will hate me for your name 
I will love them as you do 
To save the world you died upon that cross 
I will follow you Lord

{start_of_chorus: Chorus 3}
To the point of laying down your life, 	
You displayed your love for us	
Would you take my life and make it yours	
For I love you my Lord
