# Song Library

Visit the in-app [Song Library](/songs) to browse, search, and filter all available charts.

## Quick start
- Open the Song Library and start typing to search by **title** or **tag**.
- Click a result (or highlight it with the arrow keys) and press **Enter** to open the song.
- Keyboard navigation works across the list: use the **Up/Down arrows** to move the active row and **Enter** to open it.

## Filters
- Selecting multiple tags uses **ANY** matching—songs appear if they include **any** of the tags you pick.
- The **ICP only** toggle sticks between visits; its state is saved in your browser's `localStorage` so it persists across reloads on the same device.

## Deep Search
> **Deep Search:** Turn on the lyrics search toggle when you need to scan full lyrics, not just titles, tags, or authors. This issues an extra network request, so expect more data use and a brief delay, but it also expands your results to include songs where the lyrics contain your query.
