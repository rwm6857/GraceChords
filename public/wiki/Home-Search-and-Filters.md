Find songs quickly on the Home page with sticky search and filter tools.

## At a glance
- Results scroll inside a container while the NavBar stays visible
- Search matches titles, tags, and authors; optional lyrics mode
- Search can match alternate translation titles in the same song group
- Filter by tags
- Tags are case-insensitive and display in sentence case (acronyms like ICP stay uppercase)
- Keyboard: `/` focuses search, arrow keys navigate results, Enter opens

1. Start typing to search titles, tags, and authors.
2. Enable “Lyrics contain” to search within song texts (fetched on demand).
3. Use tag filters to narrow results.
4. Scroll the list without losing the search bar.

Translation note
- Home uses your saved song language preference (`pref:songLanguage`) to choose which variant opens by default when a translation is available.
