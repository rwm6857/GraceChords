Understand where things live in the codebase and what each folder provides.

## At a glance
- `src/` React app (components, pages, utils, styles, tests)
- `public/` user content and static assets
- `docs/` Vite build output for GitHub Pages (generated)
- `scripts/` maintenance utilities (index build, normalization, wiki sync)

### `src/`
SPA entry point and components. Routes include Home, SongView, Setlist builder, Songbook builder, Resources, Worship Mode, and Admin.

Key areas
- `src/utils/pdf_mvp/` — single‑song PDF engine with tests and font registrar
- `src/utils/pdf/` — facade and multi‑song/songbook exports
- `src/utils/chordpro/` — parser, serializer, normalization, and helpers
- `src/data/index.json` — generated song index; do not hand‑edit
- `src/styles/tokens.css` - UIKit-inspired design tokens (light/dark, spacing, type)
- `src/components/ui/layout-kit/` - reusable UI primitives (Card, Toolbar, Chip, etc.)
- `src/components/readings/` - Daily Word reading view (M’Cheyne plan + ESV)

### `public/`
Contains `songs/` for ChordPro files, `pptx/` for optional slide decks, `resources/` for blog posts, `wiki/` as the source of these pages, and `esv/` for generated Daily Word chapter JSON. UI fonts may live under `public/fonts/`, but PDF export fonts are bundled under `src/assets/fonts/`.

### `docs/`
Generated by `npm run build` as the GH Pages root.

### `scripts/`
Utility scripts such as `buildIndex.mjs`, `buildResourcesIndex.mjs`, `normalizeFilenames.mjs`, `ingestToChordpro.mjs`, and `syncWiki.mjs`.
