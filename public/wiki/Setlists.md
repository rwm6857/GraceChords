Build and export a worship set that remembers your choices.

## At a glance
- Add songs and drag to reorder
- Set per-song target keys
- Saved to `localStorage` (named saves)
- Export PDF or PPTX
- Share a link to the current set
- Print a quick outline

1. Search for songs and add them to the set (sticky header; results scroll independently).
2. Drag rows to reorder and adjust target keys.
3. Save sets by name. Use **Load** to open the modal and select a saved set.
4. Use **Export PDF** to merge charts or **Export PPTX** for slides (files are named with index order).
5. Use **Share Set** to copy a link that restores the exact set and target keys.
6. Print the set for a simple checklist (print-only outline is included).

Toolbar
