PDF Engine Funtionality
GraceChords is a website for storing my catalog of Christian music in the form of leadsheets. On top of showing the songs through SongView (currently working as intended), there are various PDF & JPG exporting functions. These should produce leadsheets that are highly legible, useful, and conveinent. 
Overview of PDF Engine Functionality: The core function of the engine is to take any .chordpro file and covert/export it to a formatted lead/chord sheet according to hard constraints. 

Priorities & Contraints:
1. Every page has a Song Title header and "Key of:___" subtitle
2. Every song should prioritize fitting on one page. Only in absolute worst case should spilling to a second page be considered.
3. Sections are denoted as "Verse, Chorus, Verse 1, Bridge, Tag, Intro, etc..." Section headers and their lines of lyrics should not be split up -- neither across columns nor across pages. 
4. Section headers may be shown in standard ChordPro notation/directives, or may be displayed simpler as in the Glorious King example below
5. First priority is single page printing, second prioritiy is largest possible text size; text size can range between 12pt and 15pt.
6. Third priority should be using single-column, but text may spill into a second column if necessary (not breaking sections).

Song Cases & Decision Making Ladder:
Note: "Short lines" are considered lyrical lines that fit in a column with no size reduction needed. "Long lines" are lyrical lines that might need some size reduction. "Short song" is a song that can fit within a single column. "Long song" is a song that generally needs a second column in order to fit on a single page.
Case 1 - Short Lines/Short Song

Case 2 - Long Lines/Short Song

Case 3 - Short Lines/Long Song

Case 4 - Long Lines/Long Song

Case 5 - VERY Long Lines and/or VERY Long Song
