## Project Structure
```
src/            # components, hooks, utilities, tests
public/         # ChordPro files and font assets
scripts/        # maintenance scripts (e.g., index generation)
docs/           # Vite build output for GitHub Pages
```

## Installation
Use Node.js 20 LTS and install dependencies with `npm ci`:
```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port) to explore the app.

## Testing
Run the test suite with:
```bash
npm test
```

For more detail, see the [Getting Started](../../wiki/Getting-Started) and [Contributing](../../wiki/Contributing) pages.

## Building & Deployment
Generate the static site into `docs/` and push to the `main` branch to serve via GitHub Pages:
```bash
npm run build
# commit & push -> serve from /docs
```
Keep `docs/CNAME` (custom domain) and the root `404.html` (SPA fallback) when deploying.

Routing uses hash fragments (`/#/...`) so deep links work on static hosting.

## Worship/Perform Mode
Full‚Äëscreen, minimal UI optimized for live performance.

Access
- From a song: use the ‚ÄúOpen in Worship Mode‚Äù button on the Song page.
- From a set: use ‚ÄúOpen in Worship Mode‚Äù in Setlist to load the current set.
- Direct URL: `/#/worship/<id1,id2,...>` (comma‚Äëseparated song IDs). Example: `/#/worship/abba,above-all`.

Layout & Fit
- Renders an entire song on a single page (no pagination), single column.
- Auto‚Äëfit font using the same candidate window as the PDF engine: tries sizes `16 ‚Üí 12` px and chooses the largest that fully fits the viewport; you can override manually.
- Chords render above lyrics with exact positioning; comments display in italic.

Controls (floating toolbar)
- NEXT ‚Üí: advance to next song in the list.
- Key Up (‚ôØ): raise key by 1 semitone; Reset Key: revert to original.
- Theme: toggles light/dark (persists via existing theme utilities).
- Font Size A‚àí/A+: manual override (persists); use page reload to re‚Äëenable auto‚Äëfit.
- Chords On/Off toggle.

Navigation
- Mobile/tablet: swipe left = NEXT, swipe right = PREV.
- Desktop: Arrow Right/Left keys.

Persistence
- Theme: `gracechords.theme` (via `src/utils/theme.js`).
- Worship settings: `worship:transpose`, `worship:showChords`, `worship:fontSize`.

Notes
- Worship Mode hides the site navbar for clarity (route is outside the shared `Layout`).
- Uses the same chord rendering approach as SongView for alignment.
- Keep song IDs and filenames up to date by running `npm run build-index` after adding songs.

## Admin & Index Generation
Set the admin password via an environment variable and open `/#/admin` to author songs in ChordPro. Use Stage to queue changes; you can either publish a PR or download a ZIP of staged files.

```bash
VITE_ADMIN_PW=your-password # in .env
npm run build-index
```

Add `VITE_ADMIN_PW` to a local `.env` file for development and configure the same variable as a GitHub repository secret so builds receive it.

Admin highlights:
- Load an existing song from the index, edit in place, and Stage to queue changes.
- ‚ÄúEdits Author‚Äù is required when publishing ‚Äî your name is appended to the PR body.
- Publish Staged opens a PR with staged files; Download Staged saves a ZIP for manual copy.
- Quick chord buttons insert `[C]`, `[Am]`, etc., at the caret; buttons adapt to the song‚Äôs key (I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi).

Manual publish (no PR):
1) Stage ‚Üí Download Staged ‚Üí unzip ‚Üí copy to `public/songs/` ‚Üí `npm run build-index` ‚Üí `npm run build`.

## Resources (Guides/Articles)
GraceChords includes a lightweight resources/blog system for worship teams.

- Content lives in `public/resources/*.md` with YAML-style frontmatter:

  ```md
  ---
  title: "Leading Worship with Confidence"
  author: "Ryan Moore"
  date: "2025-09-10"
  tags: ["leadership", "vocals"]
  summary: "Practical tips for worship leaders."
  ---

  # Heading
  Markdown content‚Ä¶
  ```

- Index page: `/#/resources` ‚Äî grid of cards, search (title/summary, falls back to content), tag filters.
- Post page: `/#/resources/:slug` ‚Äî renders Markdown with support for images, links, blockquotes, lists, headings, code, and raw HTML embeds (e.g., YouTube iframes).
- Admin editor: `/#/admin/resources` ‚Äî create/edit posts with live preview and PR publishing (uses the same GitHub token flow as songs). Requires the ‚ÄúEdits Author‚Äù field.

Build & CI
- Rebuild resources index after adding/editing `.md` files:
  ```bash
  npm run build-resources-index
  ```
- CI workflow `.github/workflows/update-resources.yml` watches `public/resources/**`, runs the index builder, and commits `src/data/resources.json`. That commit triggers the site build workflow to update `docs/`.

## PDF Fonts
Place the following fonts in `public/fonts/` to embed them in exported PDFs:
- `NotoSans-Regular.ttf`
- `NotoSans-Bold.ttf`
- `NotoSans-Italic.ttf`
- `NotoSans-BoldItalic.ttf`
- `NotoSansMono-Regular.ttf`
- `NotoSansMono-Bold.ttf`

## Normalization
Keep filenames consistent and avoid duplicates before building the index:

```bash
npm run normalize
npm run build-index
```

The normalizer converts hyphens/spaces to underscores (e.g., `all-in-all.chordpro` ‚Üí `all_in_all.chordpro`) and, when both forms exist, keeps the underscore file and deletes the hyphen one. It also copies/renames PPTX from `TO_RENAME/` to `public/pptx/` with normalized names.

## Disclaimer Controls
Set `VITE_ENABLE_DISCLAIMER=0` to disable the site footer, ChordPro comment block appending, and PDF footers. Optionally set `VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL=you@example.com` to append a contact line in site/ChordPro disclaimers.

## Importing Lyrics (DOCX/PDF/TXT ‚Üí ChordPro)
Convert documents into a ChordPro skeleton with section blocks. Default output uses short ChordPro directives.

```bash
# DOCX ‚Üí ChordPro (directives default)
npm run ingest -- path/to/song.docx

# PDF ‚Üí ChordPro (default output: public/songs)
npm run ingest -- path/to/song.pdf

# Plain headers instead of directives
npm run ingest -- path/to/song.pdf --plain
```

Notes
- Optional deps: `mammoth` for DOCX, `pdf-parse` for PDF.
- Default wraps sections using `{sov|soc|sob}` / `{eov|eoc|eob}`; `--plain` emits readable headers (e.g., `Verse 1`, `Pre‚ÄëChorus`).
- Output directory must exist. By default it is `public/songs`. Use `--out <dir>` to override.
- If the target filename already exists, the tool interactively asks to Overwrite, Rename, Skip, or Abort.
- After import: `npm run normalize && npm run build-index`.
- The tool strips a leading title duplicate and recognizes lines like `(Key of G)` to populate `{key: G}` while removing the line from lyrics. Pure chord-only lines are ignored.
- Output filenames use underscores by default (e.g., `above_all.chordpro`).

## CI & Automation
- Build to `docs/` (site code changes): `build-to-docs.yml` runs on changes under `src/**`, `index.html`, `404.html`, `vite.config.js`, `package*.json`, and `public/**` (excluding `public/songs/**` and `public/wiki/**`). Uses Node 20 and commits `docs/` with `VITE_COMMIT_SHA=${{ github.sha }}`.
- Song changes ‚Üí index then build: `update-index.yml` runs on `public/songs/**`, executes `node scripts/buildIndex.mjs`, commits `src/data/index.json`. That commit triggers the site build workflow above.
- Resource changes ‚Üí index then build: `update-resources.yml` runs on `public/resources/**`, executes `node scripts/buildResourcesIndex.mjs`, commits `src/data/resources.json`. That commit triggers the site build workflow above.
- Wiki changes ‚Üí sync then build: `wiki-sync.yml` runs on `public/wiki/**`, executes `node scripts/syncWiki.mjs` (requires `WIKI_PUSH_TOKEN` secret), then builds and commits `docs/`.
- Docs-only commits are ignored by the build workflow.
- Concurrency: the build workflow cancels in-progress runs to avoid overlapping `docs/` commits.

**PDF Export (MVP Engine)**
- **Engine:** single-song, setlist, and songbook exporters live at `src/utils/pdf_mvp/` (facade: `src/utils/pdf/`).
- **Decision ladder:** 1-col single page at sizes `16 ‚Üí 12` pt; else 2-col at `16 ‚Üí 12` pt; else 1-col multipage at 15 pt (header only on page 1).
- **Typography:** Title 26 pt bold; Key 16 pt italic gray (`rgb(90,90,90)`); lyrics/chords 12‚Äì16 pt with ~1.2√ó line-height; section headers same size as lyrics (bold).
- **Chords:** appear above the exact lyric character; no overlaps (‚â• one space width); trailing chords flush to end.
- **Sections:** never split across columns/pages; compact, consistent spacing.
- **Songbook TOC:** entries show ‚Äú#. Title‚Äù (no page numbers). Defaults to one column; switches to two before spilling to a second page; continued pages use two columns. Default cover shows ‚ÄúGraceChords Songbook‚Äù + date.
- **Tests:** run `npm run test:mvp` to guard column/size/page decisions, chord alignment, header spacing.
- See `src/utils/pdf_mvp/README.md` and the wiki page for details.

## PPTX Slides
Place PowerPoint lyric decks in `public/pptx/` named after the song's file name without the `.chordpro` extension.
For example, a song stored as `public/songs/glorious-king.chordpro` can have slides at `public/pptx/glorious-king.pptx`.
Files committed under `public/` are served directly by GitHub Pages, so adding a PPTX is as simple as dropping it in this directory and committing.

## Offline Support
GraceChords registers a service worker to make core assets available offline. During the install event it pre-caches the app shell (`index.html`), the song index, and bundled fonts. At runtime the worker caches additional scripts, styles, fonts, documents, assets under `/assets/` or `/src/data/`, and individual song files as they are fetched.

The cache name includes a commit hash from the `VITE_COMMIT_SHA` environment variable so that each deployment invalidates older caches. Set it when building to force clients to fetch the latest files, for example:

```bash
VITE_COMMIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD) npm run build
```

During development you can disable the worker by commenting out its registration in `index.html` or by unregistering via the browser console:

```js
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(rs => rs.forEach(r => r.unregister()));
```

Song files (`/songs/**`) and the index (`/src/data/index.json`) are fetched with a network‚Äëfirst strategy so edits appear promptly after deploy. To pick up changes without a full rebuild, call `navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistration().then(r => r.update())` or clear cached data.

## Usage Notes
- **Home**: search and tag filters, select-all/clear, per-song key, bundle builder at `/bundle`.
- **Song page**: vertical layout, sticky toolbar (transpose & download), chord toggle (on by default), 1/2‚Äëcolumn reading view, collapsible media.
- **Setlist**: `/setlist` lets you build/reorder sets, choose keys, save/load by name (modal), share a link, and export PDF/PPTX. Headers are sticky within each pane; panes scroll independently.
- **Songbook**: builder mirrors Setlist layout and width; sticky header with inline search and ‚ÄúAdd all‚Äù. Export always includes a TOC; optional cover image.
- **PDFs**: vector text with Noto Sans; sections stay together; layout auto‚Äëswitches to two columns when needed.

## Sorting & Index
- The index builder ignores files prefixed with `test_*.chordpro`.
- Sorting places numeric titles first; otherwise titles are compared case‚Äëinsensitively, ignoring leading punctuation (e.g., `'Tis` sorted under `T`).

## Next Steps
Explore utilities in `src/utils` for chord transposition and PDF generation, check `scripts/buildIndex.mjs` for index creation, and extend Vitest tests to safeguard future refactors.

## GitHub Wiki

Author or edit Markdown pages under `public/wiki/` (e.g., `Home.md`, `_Sidebar.md`, etc.).
Set the repo secret `WIKI_PUSH_TOKEN` (a classic PAT with `repo` scope) to allow pushes to `GraceChords.wiki`.
Trigger sync by pushing changes under `public/wiki/**` (workflow runs) or run locally:

```bash
WIKI_PUSH_TOKEN=<your_PAT> node scripts/syncWiki.mjs
```

If pages don‚Äôt appear, run the diagnostic:

```bash
node scripts/verifyWikiSetup.mjs
```
