Verse 1
This is a [C]fairly long line that should [F]wrap once in a [C]half-width column
Another [C]mid-length line with [F]chords near the [G]edge to test [C]wrapping
Keeping [C]content balanced so the [F]pack chooses two [G]columns on one [C]page
Where the [C]width is tight, a [F]wrap should [G]occur gracefully [C]here

Chorus
[F]Closer to the middle we [C]place the chords just [G]right
[F]Lines that want to wrap will [C]do so clean and [G]tight
[F]Let every segment [C]flow into the [G]space
[F]Neatly aligned in each [C]columnâ€™s measured [G]place
