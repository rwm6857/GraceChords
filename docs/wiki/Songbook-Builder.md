Create a PDF songbook from selected songs without transposition.

## At a glance
- Checkbox list with search and filters like Home
- Sticky header with inline search and ICP-only toggle
- “Add all” respects current filters (primary, right-aligned)
- Export is alphabetized and numbered
- Always generates a table of contents; optional cover image
- TOC defaults to one column, switches to two columns to avoid spilling to page 2; if continued, stays two‑column
- Default cover page shows “GraceChords Songbook” and today’s date
- Sections never split across pages

1. Filter and search for songs, then check the ones to include.
2. Use **Add all** to pick every filtered song.
3. Export to PDF; songs are alphabetized with numbers.
4. The PDF always includes a TOC (entries as "#. Title", no page numbers). If no cover is supplied, a default cover shows the title and today’s date (MM.DD.YYYY).
