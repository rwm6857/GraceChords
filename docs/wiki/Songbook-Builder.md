Create a PDF songbook from selected songs without transposition.

## At a glance
- Checkbox list with search and filters like Home
- **Select all** respects current filters
- Export is alphabetized and numbered
- Generates a table of contents and optional cover
- TOC defaults to one column, switches to two columns to avoid spilling to page 2; if continued, stays two‑column
- Default cover page shows “GraceChords Songbook” and today’s date
- Sections never split across pages

1. Filter and search for songs, then check the ones to include.
2. Use **Select all** to pick every filtered song.
3. Export to PDF; songs are alphabetized with numbers.
4. The PDF includes an auto‑generated TOC (entries as "#. Title", no page numbers). If no cover is supplied, a default cover shows the title and today’s date (MM.DD.YYYY).
