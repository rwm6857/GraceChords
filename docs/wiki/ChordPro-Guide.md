# ChordPro Guide

GraceChords reads standard ChordPro with a few conventions. Helpful when using the [[Admin-Tool]].

## Headers
Headers are case-insensitive. Sentence case is acceptable:
```
{title: Glorious King}
{artist: Example Band}
{key: G}
{tags: Easter, Fast}
{authors: Jane Doe}
{country: US}
```

## Lines
- Place chords in square brackets within lyrics: `You [G]are the [D]light`
- Leave chord-less lines blank; they render as spacing

## Tips
- Use `{comment:}` for notes to players
- Avoid trailing spaces; they affect layout
- Keep tags short; they fuel [[Search-and-Tags]]
