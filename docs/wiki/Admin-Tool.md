# Admin Tool

A lightweight editor for creating ChordPro files.

## Use
- Navigate to `/admin` and enter the password
- Compose or paste text, preview the render, and export
- Select multiple songs to download as a ZIP of `.chordpro`

## Password
Set `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` for deploys. Without it, a default password allows access. Keep this tool private.

See [[ChordPro-Guide]] for formatting tips. After adding songs, run [[Index-Building]].
