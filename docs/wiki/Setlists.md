# Setlists

Plan services by collecting songs into a setlist.

## Basics
- Use **Add to Setlist** from [[SongView]] or the search results
- Drag to reorder; click to remove
- Lists persist in `localStorage`

## Export
- Bundle the list as a combined PDF or PPTX
- Print a simple list of titles and keys

Setlists feed into [[Songbook-Builder]] for longer compilations.
