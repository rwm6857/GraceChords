        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Up and fight against the devil you whose sins are washed away
Bold against the host of evil come and gather for the fray
See the judgement coming closer and perdition’s awful day
The day is almost here

Glory, Glory, halle-lu-jah!  Glory, Glory, hallelu-jah!
Glory, Glory, halle-lu-jah!  For triumph drawing near

Up and fight against the devil you whose sins are washed away
Jesus Christ is waiting open arm’d for all who trust and pray
He is eager to assist you come to him and don’t delay
Come now his call is clear!

Up and fight against the devil you whose sins are washed away
Ever nearer comes the tumult of the foe’s immense array
Cast our own offenses from us and the sins that so betray
Trust God and cast out fear!</pre>
