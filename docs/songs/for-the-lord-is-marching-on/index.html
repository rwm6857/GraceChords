        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">For the Lord is marching on
And His army is ever strong
And His glory shall be seen upon our land
Raise the anthem, sing the victory song
Praise the Lord for the battle's won
No weapon formed against us shall stand

For the captain of the host is Jesus
We're following in His footsteps
No foe can stand against us in the fray
For the captain of the host is Jesus
We're following in His footsteps
No foe can stand against us in the fray

We are marching in Messiah's band
The keys of victory in His mighty hand
Let us march on to take our promised land
For the Lord is marching
And His army is ever strong
And His glory shall be seen upon our land</pre>
