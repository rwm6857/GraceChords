        <h1>Goodbye Yesterday</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Goodbye yesterday
I’m living in the light of a new day
I won’t waste another minute in my old ways
Praise the Lord I’ve been born again

Goodbye yesterday
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
I’ve got resurrection in my veins
Praise the Lord I’ve been born again

Again and again and again and again
You rescued me out of the mess I was in
Traded my sorrow for something to sing
I’m dancing on the grave that I once lived in

 I have decided
 To follow Jesus
 The world behind
The cross before I won’t turn back

I won’t turn back
I won’t turn back
The world behind
The cross before I won’t turn back

I’m dancing on the grave that I once lived in
I’m dancing on the grave that I once lived in
I’m dancing on the grave that I once lived in
I’m dancing on the grave that I once lived in
I’m dancing on the grave that I once lived in
I’m dancing on the grave that I once lived in
I’m dancing on the grave that I once lived in
Praise the Lord I’ve been born again</pre>
