        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Man of Sorrows, what a name! For the Son of God, Who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim. Hallelujah! What a Savior!

Bearing shame and scoffing rude, In my place condemned He stood;
Sealed my pardon with His blood. Hallelujah! What a Savior!

Guilty, vile, and helpless we; Spotless Lamb of God was He;
Full atonement! Can it be? Hallelujah! What a Savior!

Lifted up was He to die; "It is finished!" was His cry;
Now in heaven exalted high. Hallelujah! What a Savior!

When He comes, our glorious King, All His ransomed home to bring,
Then anew His song we'll sing: Hallelujah! What a Savior!</pre>
