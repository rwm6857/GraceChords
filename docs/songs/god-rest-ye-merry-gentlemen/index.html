        <h1>God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">God rest ye merry, gentlemen;
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's pow'r
When we were gone a-stray

O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy!
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel,
This blessed Babe was born,
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn;
Of which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn.

From God our heav'nly Father,
A blessed angel came;
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same;
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name.</pre>
