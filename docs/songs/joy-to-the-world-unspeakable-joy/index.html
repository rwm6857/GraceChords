        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Joy to the world the Lord is come
Let Earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and Heaven
And nature sing

Joy to the world the Savior reigns
Let all their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat repeat the sounding joy

Joy unspeakable joy
Overflowing well
No tongue can tell

Joy unspeakable joy
Rises in my soul
Never lets me go

He rules the world
With truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders wonders of His love</pre>
