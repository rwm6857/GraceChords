        <h1>Because He Lives</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus, He came to love, heal, and forgive;
He lived and died to buy my pardon;
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.

Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
Because He lives, all fear is gone;
Because I know He holds the future,
And life is worth the living just because He lives.

How sweet to hold a newborn baby and feel the pride and joy he gives;
But greater still the calm assurance
This child can face uncertain days because He lives.

Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
Because He lives, all fear is gone;
Because I know He holds the future,
And life is worth the living just because He lives.

And then one day I'll cross that river; I'll fight life's final war with pain;
And then as death gives way to vict'ry,
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives.

Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
Because He lives, all fear is gone;
Because I know He holds the future,
And life is worth the living just because He lives.
And life is worth the living just because He lives.</pre>
