        <h1>King of Kings (InterCP Int’l Ver.)</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">In the darkness we were waiting, without hope, without light
‘Til from heaven you came running, there was mercy in your eyes
To fulfill the law and prophets, to a virgin came the Word
From a throne of endless glory, to a cradle in the dirt

To reveal the kingdom coming and to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation, you did not despise the cross
For even in your suffering, you saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation, Jesus for our sake you died

And the morning that you rose, all of heaven held its breath
‘Til that stone was moved for good, for the Lamb had conquered death
And the dead rose from their tombs, and the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who’d come to the Father are restored

And the church of Christ was born, then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old shall not kneel, shall not faint
By the power of his blood, he has set all nations free
Every nation shall rejoice and bow before the King of kings

Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, majesty
Praise forever to the King of kings</pre>
