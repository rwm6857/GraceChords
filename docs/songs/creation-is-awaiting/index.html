        <h1>Creation is Awaiting</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Creation is awaiting the return of the Lord
The trees are poised to clap their hands for joy
The mountains stand majestic to salute their God
The desert lies in wait to burst into bloom

The Lord is surely coming soon
Creation longs to see, the coming of our Lord
The Lord is surely coming soon
Creation longs to see, the coming eof our Lord

The saints are awaiting the return of the Lord
His blood has washed us clean, we are redeemed
He has made us holy people, we will stand as one
As a bride longs for her groom the church will proclaim

The Lord is surely coming soon
We will prepare the way, the coming of our Lord
The Lord is surely coming soon
We will prepare the way, the coming of our Lord

The nations are awaiting the return of the King
The earth is a footstool for his feet.
Ev’ry knee will bow down, ev’ry tongue confess,
That Jesus Christ is Lord of heaven and earth

The King is coming, the King is coming
Our Lord is coming, in glory He will reign
The King is coming, the King is coming
Yeshua Lord and King, reigns in majesty</pre>
