        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">In this quite place with you
I bow before your throne
I bear the deepest part of me
To you and you alone
I keep no secrets

For there is no thought
That you have known
I bring my best and all the rest
To you I lay them down

With all my heart
I want to love you Lord
And live my life
Each day to know you more
All that is in me
Is yours completely
I'll serve you only
With all my heart

You faithfully supply my needs
According to your plans
So help me Lord to seek your face
Before I seek your hand
And trust you know what 's best for me
When I don't understand
Then follow in obedience
In every circumstance

I'll serve you only, with all my heart</pre>
