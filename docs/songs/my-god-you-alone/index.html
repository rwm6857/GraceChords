        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">My God, you alone are Lord and King
I will praise and worship you
The love I have for you inside my heart
My Lord, is made known to you

And though -- I have no alabaster jar
No fragrant oil to give to you
I long to be like you in all of your ways
Renew my heart and spirit once again

My heart which wanders in the midst of pain
It cannot find its way to you
But by your love and everlasting grace
Guide me in the path of righteousness</pre>
