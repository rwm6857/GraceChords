[VERSE]
[Cm]Blood of the missionaries [D#]shed across the [G#]earth [A#]
The last breath of our [Gm7]brothers [A#]witnessed [A#7]across the [Cm7]nations [Gm7] [G7] [G#]
The endless flow of our [Fm7]tears, becoming eternal [D#]praise
Our faith will be made [A#7]new again, in the [D#]hope of heavenâ€™s victory

[VERSE]
Faces of the martyrs, shine like the sun
The hearts of young people burn like a blazing fire
Wind of the Holy Spirit blowing towards the west
We will gladly give up our lives, on the road of final revival

[D#]Breaking the power of [F]fear and [D7]death
[Gm7]We will go out to the ends of the [Dm]earth
