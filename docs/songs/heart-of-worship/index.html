        <h1>Heart of Worship</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">When the music fades, all is stripped away
And I simply come
Longing just to bring
something that's of worth
That will bless Your heart

Pre-Chorus
I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
is not what You have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about You, it's all about You
Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
When it's all about You, it's all about You
Jesus

King of endless worth
no one could express
How much You deserve
Though I'm weak and poor
all I have is Yours
Ev'ry single breath</pre>
