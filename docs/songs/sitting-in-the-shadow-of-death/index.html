        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Sitting in the shadow of death
My people they are dying away
My people who are trapped in hunger and despair
Are the deep sorrow of my heart

Bound within the yoke of pain
My children crying in despair
In this time I will rise to break off their yoke
How I long to wipe away their tears

Who will cry out for them to me
To save them from their death and pain
Who will go out to them for me
To share my love that can save

How I long for the coming of that day
When my children are raised to life again
As the heavens fill with songs of praise
Let the sound of joy and laughter fill the land</pre>
