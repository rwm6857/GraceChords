        <h1>Dreams of Heaven</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">From up above came the Father’s heart, the longing to dream the dreams of heaven
All love once lost, will be restored, together we’ll stand renewed in faith
Longing to live, and see his will be done on earth,
Denying the things that are of this world
Though we may lose our lives on earth, In heaven we'll meet once again

Following the light this generation will arise
Every darkness flees, we have victory
Holding to his great command, at the frontiers we will stand,
Salvation’s in his mighty hand

Now we rise up and will go to the ends of the earth
In holiness we pray, worship and give praise
The cross in our hand, we'll proclaim victory
Following the way of our great king

By the hope of heaven, we have unity
In his name we have victory
No matter what the suffering, we’ll share in His glory
We see the coming of that day

Jesus Christ you are, Son of the Living God
Who was and is and is to come</pre>
