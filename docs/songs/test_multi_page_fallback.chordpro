Verse 1
[A]This is a very long lyric line intended to [E]wrap multiple times in a single column and even a two-column layout may not contain all sections on one page because [D]we will include many lines to force the fallback to a multi-page plan
[A]Another very long line continuing the [E]pattern so that we deliberately test the fallback [D]behavior across pages without breaking sections
[A]We keep adding more content to [E]ensure height grows [D]well beyond what two columns can support in a single page at larger sizes
[A]As we continue the [E]sequence we verify [D]that page breaks occur only between sections
[A]Continue until we [E]have sufficient [D]lines to exceed the capacity
[A]This should make it [E]clear across the [D]layout
[A]More words and [E]consistent wrap [D]behavior follows
[A]Testing [E]multi-page [D]fallback now
[A]Filling [E]lines to [D]trigger the case
[A]Adding [E]even more [D]content here
[A]And [E]still [D]more lines
[A]To [E]reach [D]overflow
[A]Yet [E]another [D]segment
[A]Almost [E]there [D]now
[A]Final [E]push [D]to spill

Verse 2
[A]Second section ensures [E]we have a clean [D]page break
[A]Still long enough to [E]go beyond [D]a single page
[A]Wrapping [E]correctly [D]across pages
[A]Keeping [E]sections [D]intact
[A]No [E]splits [D]allowed
[A]Ending [E]soon [D]now
