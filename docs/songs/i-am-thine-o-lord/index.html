        <h1>I Am Thine O Lord</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">I am thine, O Lord, I have heard thy voice,
And it told thy love to me;
But I long to rise in the arms of faith
And be closer drawn to thee.

Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord,
To the cross where thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer blessed Lord,
To thy precious, bleeding side.

Consecrate me now to thy service Lord,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up with steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in thine.

O the pure delight of a single hour
That before thy throne I spend;
When I kneel in prayer and with thee O God,
I commune as friend with friend.

There are depths of love that I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy that I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with thee.</pre>
