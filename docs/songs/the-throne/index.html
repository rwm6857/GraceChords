        <h1>The Throne</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">In the heav'nly realm there is a throne
On it sits the Ancient of Days
Awesome, mighty, flowing with grace

And a host of angels at His throne
Carry out His will and sing Him praise
Humbly serving through night and day

Holy, holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy, holy

Now the temple veil is two has split
And the blood of Christ for all has flowed
Glory, honor, worship, and praise!

Now my life with Christ in God is hid
And my God in heaven I'll behold
Know His goodness, tell of His ways

Rise up, a nation of our God
Rise up, a priesthood of our King
Forever His mighty deed proclaim
Declaring His glory to all nations

Now the temple veil in two has
And the blood of Christ for all has flowed
Glory, honor, worship, and praise!</pre>
