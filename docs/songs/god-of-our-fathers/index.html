        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">God of our fathers we lift up your name
You keep your promises, you make a way
Rock and Defender, we trust in your name
The name of Yeshua

God of our fathers we lift up your name
You are the Comforter, Giver of joy
In times of trouble, our peace is in you
The name of Yeshua

We praise you Lord, Savior of all the earth
All nations and tribes will praise Yeshua
Your holy name shall be exalted on high
The name of Yeshua
The name of Yeshua

God of our fathers we lift up your name
You fill our needs and your word never fails
You are our God and we trust in your ways
The name of Yeshua

God of our fathers we lift up your name
You’ve set us free and you took all our shame
The joy of salvation is found in you Lord
The name of Yeshua

Yeshua you are our Saviour and King
You are Messiah, EmManuel

Yeshua Yeshua Yeshua Emmanuel</pre>
