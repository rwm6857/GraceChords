        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Here I am again just looking for the words that help me say that,
My heart is full of love and praises
I must have prayed a thousand prayers and sung a hundred songs,
But I just have to say again

Oh how I love you
More than words can say
In the deepest heart-felt way
Oh how Lord I love you
Once again receive my praise

So many words, so many songs, so many melodies, yet,
Allow me one more declaration
You are the lover of my soul, the center of my life
So I just have to say again

Thank you for a brand new day,
A brand new chance to stand and say
I love you

Help me find the words to say that
Tell you in a brand new way
I love you</pre>
