        <h1>A Mighty Fortress Is Our God</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">A mighty fortress is our God, a Bulwark never failing;
Our Helper He amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing;
For still our ancient Foe doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and pow'r are great, and armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing;
Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God's own choosing;
Dost ask who that may be: Christ Jesus it is He;
Lord Sabbaoth His name, from age to age the same,
And He must win the battle.

And though this world with devils filled should threaten to undo us;
We will not fear for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us:
The prince of darkness grim, we tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure for lo, his doom is sure,
One little word shall fell him.

That Word above all earthly pow'r, no thanks to them abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him who with us sideth;
Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also;
The body they may kill; God's truth abideth still,
His kingdom is forever!</pre>
