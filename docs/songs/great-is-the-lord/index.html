        <h1>Great is the Lord</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Great is the Lord our God
And worthy to be praised
All nations come worship him
In his holy place

We praise and lift up your name
Almighty God and King
Jesus my Lord and my God
I will love you and praise you forever
Yeshua

Hallelujah, Yeshua reigns in victory
Hallelujah, Yeshua our eternal King

You are eternal God
We give you all our praise
All nations come worship Him
In his holy place

All tribes and peoples and tongues
Will bow before our God
Blessing and honor and glory
Elohim ruler of all the nations
Give him praise

Great are you Elohim
We give you all our praise
All nations come worship him
In his holy place

On that day we will see
The face of our God
As people of God we will rise
He will wipe every tear from our eyes
And sorrow and mourning will cease
Forevermore

All nations come worship him
Give praise and glory to God
Hallelujah Yeshua
You are eternal King</pre>
