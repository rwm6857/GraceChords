        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Great is your faithfulness oh God
You wrestle with the sinner’s heart
You lead us by still waters into mercy
And nothing can keep us apart

So remember your people
Remember your children
Remember your promise, oh God

Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough for me

Great is your love and justice God
You use the weak to lead the strong
You lead us in the song of your salvation
And all your people sing along

Your grace is enough
Heavens reaching down to us
Your grace is enough for me

God I see, Your grace is enough
I’m covered in your love
Your grace is enough for me</pre>
