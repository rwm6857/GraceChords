        <h1>Christ Is Enough</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Christ is my reward
And all of my devotion
Now there's nothing in this world
That could ever satisfy
Through every trial
My soul will sing
No turning back
I've been set free

Christ is enough for me
Christ is enough for me
Everything I need is in You
Everything I need

Christ my all in all
The joy of my salvation
And this hope will never fail
Heaven is our home
Through every storm
My soul will sing
Jesus is here
To God be the glory

Christ is enough for me
Christ is enough for me
Everything I need is in You
Everything I need

I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back
No turning back
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back
No turning back (the cross)
The cross before me
The world behind me
No turning back
No turning back
The cross before me
The world behind me
No turning back
No turning back</pre>
