        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">I was so far away
From the love of the cross
In my shame and my brokenness
I forgot Your grace
But You came close to me
Touched my hardened heart
You restore me to stand again
I love You my Lord

Lord, You alone protect me
Hold me close to You
I am precious and loved by You
I am a child of God
God, He alone protects you
He will hold you close
You are precious and loved by Him
You're a child of God

I will no longer dwell
On the things of the past
Everything I've done in the past
I leave it all behind
Lord you make rivers flow
in the desert place
I will lift my eyes to the Lord
He will make all things new</pre>
