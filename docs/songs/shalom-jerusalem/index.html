        <h1>Shalom Jerusalem</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Pray for peace Jerusalem, city of our God
There salvation was poured out for you, the atoning of the Lord
Once your streets were filled with joy, branches raised up high
Shouting, "Blessed be the Holy One, Yeshua Adonai"

Shalom shalom Jerusalem peace be to you
When Messiah comes to take us home
May His praise be found in you

Israel beloved, Ephraim my son, how my heart would thrill to hear you say,
"Our Messiah has come!"
Oh my brothers hear these words, may they pierce your soul
Turn again to worship Adonai, Messiah Yeshua</pre>
