        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Light of the World
You stepped down into darkness,
Opened my eyes, let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You,
Hope of a life spent with You

Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me

King of all days
Oh so highly exalted,
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to the Earth You created,
All for love's sake became poor

And I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross</pre>
