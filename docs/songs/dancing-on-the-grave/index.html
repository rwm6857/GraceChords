        <h1>Dancing on the grave</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">You throw a party
In the presence of my enemies
You invite me to the table
And You tell me just to sit and feast
You are not afraid
When the terrors screaming loud at me
'Cause You've overcome
And You're the God of victory

Repeat Intro

Repeat Verse 1

I'm dancing on the grave
That once held me bound

I'm dancing on the chains
That are laying on the ground
I'm dancing out of the dark
I'm lighting up the night

Your joy becomes a weapon
And I am here to fight (Yeah)

Interlude
V10]

When I walk through the valley
Of the shadow, I will not fear death
I know You're by my side
And You'll never leave me by myself
So even when I'm weary
You are calling me to come and rest
'Cause You cannot be stopped
You have already defeated hell
Oh, You cannot be stopped
You have already defeated hell

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Interlude

The enemy may be all around me
But I'm running free

'Cause You set me free

Channel
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Repeat Chorus

Oh, oh, oh. I am here to fight oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh</pre>
