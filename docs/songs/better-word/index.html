        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Your blood is healing ev’ry wound
Your blood is making all things new
Your blood speaks a better word
Your blood, the measure of my worth
Your blood, more than I deserve
Your blood speaks a better word
Speaks a better word

It’s singing out with life
It’s shouting down the lies
It echoes through the night
The precious blood of Christ
Speaks a better word, speaks a better word

It’s calling out my name
And it’s breaking ev’ry chain
It’s making all things right
The precious blood of Christ
Speaks a better word
Speaks a better word

Your blood, a robe of righteousness
Your blood, my hope and my defense
Your blood forever covers me
Oh, forever covers me

It’s rewriting my history
It covers me with destiny
It’s making all things right
The precious blood of Christ

Whoah
Whoah
Is making all things right
The precious blood of Christ
Speaks a better word
Speaks a better word</pre>
