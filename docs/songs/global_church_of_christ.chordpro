{sov: Verse}
The cross of our Christ is an everlasting love	
A love that holds, never fails	
We will go towards Jerusalem with this truth of Christ. 	
With no hesitation, we will stand	

{eov}
{soc: Pre-Chorus}
Though hardships come with persecution's pain, 	
We know our faith will grow stronger still.	
Prepare the way, let his kingdom come	
His church will rise and be victorious! 	

{eoc}
{soc: Chorus}
Holding the word the Lord commands, 	
Rise up oh Global Church of Christ	
We will not turn back nor flee, 	
When we're faced with death and fear 	
Holding revival in our hearts,	
Rise up oh Global Church of Christ 	
Till our Jesus comes in glory as the King	

{eoc}
