        <h1>Another In The Fire</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">There's a grace when the heart is under fire,
Another way when the walls are closing in,
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning,
I know I will never be alone

There was another in the fire
Standing next to me,
There was another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
Of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden
Where another died for me,
There is another in the fire

All my debt left for dead beneath the waters,
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore,
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me, and this reckoning,
Either way, I won't bow
To the things of this world,
And I know I will never be alone

There is another in the fire
Standing next to me,
There is another in the waters
Holding back the seas,
And should I ever need reminding,
What power set me free,
There is a grave that holds no body,
And that power lives in me,
There is another in the fire oh oh

And I can see the light, in the darkness
As the darkness bows to Him,
I can hear the roar, in the heavens
As the space between wears thin
I can feel the ground, shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in,
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between us

There is no other name,
But the Name, that is Jesus,
He who was and still is
And will be through it all,
So come what may in the space between,
All the things unseen, and this reckoning,
I know I will never be alone,
I know I will never be alone

There'll be another in the fire,
Standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters,
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
How good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be</pre>
