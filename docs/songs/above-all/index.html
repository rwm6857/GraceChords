        <h1>Above All</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Above all powers, above all kings,
Above all nature and all created things.
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man,
You were here before the world began.

Above all kingdoms, above all thrones.
Above all wonders this world has ever known.
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth,
There’s no way to measure what you’re worth.

Crucified, laid behind the stone,
You lived to die, rejected and alone.
Like a rose, trampled on the ground,
You took the fall, and now you reign, above all.
(You took the fall, and now your reign, Yeshua)</pre>
