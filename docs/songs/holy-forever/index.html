        <h1>Holy Forever</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">A thousand generations
Falling down in worship
To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
And all who've gone before us
And all who will believe
Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb

Pre-Chorus 1
Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all
All thrones and dominions
All powers and positions
Your name stands above them all

And the angels cry: Ho  -  ly
All creation cries: Ho  -  ly
You are lifted high, ho  -  ly
Holy forever
Hear your people sing: Ho  -  ly
To the King of kings, ho  -  ly
You will always be ho  -  ly
Holy forever

If you've been forgiven
And if you've been redeemed
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
If you walk in freedom
And if you bear His name
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
We'll sing the song forever and amen

Pre-Chorus 2
Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all
All thrones and dominions
All powers and positions
Your name stands above them all

You will always be ho  -  ly
Holy forever</pre>
