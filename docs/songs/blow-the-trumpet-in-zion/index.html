Great is the army commanded by the Lord
Rush in the city, march to the wall
Great is the army commanded by the Lord

The Lord declares his voice
Be strong and mighty
The Lord declares his voice
Be strong and mighty

Blow the trumpets of war in Zion
Sound them in the holy mountain
Blow the trumpets of war in Zion
Let them resound</pre>
