        <h1>Praise</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Let everything
That has breath
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord

I'll praise in the valley
Praise on the mountain
I'll praise when I'm sure
Praise when I'm doubting
I'll praise when outnumbered
Praise when surrounded
Cause praise is the waters
My enemies drown in

Pre-Chorus
As long as I'm breathing
I've got a reason to

Pra  -  ise the Lord oh my soul
Pra  -  ise the Lord oh my soul
I won't be quiet
My God is alive
How could I keep it inside
Pra  -  ise the Lord oh my soul

I'll praise when I feel it
I'll praise when I don't
I'll praise cause I know
You're still in control
My praise is a weapon
It's more than a sound
My praise is the shout
That brings Jericho down

I'll praise cause You're sovereign
Praise cause You reign
Praise cause You rose
And defeated the grave
I'll praise cause You're faithful
Praise cause You're true
Praise cause there's nobody
Greater than You</pre>
