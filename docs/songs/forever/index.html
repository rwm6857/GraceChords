His love endures forever
For He is good, He is above all things
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise

With a mighty hand and outstretched arm
His love endures forever
For the life that's been reborn
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise, Sing praise, sing praise

Forever God is faithful, forever God is strong
Forever God is with us forever, and ever forever

From the rising to the setting sun
His love endures forever
And by the grace of God we will carry on
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise, sing praise, sing praise</pre>
