        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Lord we seek and yearn for your everlasting love
Lord we seek and yearn for your everlasting peace
Mighty God, who is Lord and Creator of all things
How deep is the love you have for us

Lord we seek to worship you and bow before your throne
Lord we seek to become like you in your righteousness
Mighty God, who is Lord and Creator of all things
You have called me your beloved child

With eyes of love you look to us
God of love, you will never turn away
With ears of grace you hear our cries
God of grace, may you receive our every prayer

Lord you shine your light through all our darkness and all fear
Answer every cry and Lord you wipe away our tears
We will follow you, Lord wherever you will go
We will look to you alone

We will look to you alone</pre>
