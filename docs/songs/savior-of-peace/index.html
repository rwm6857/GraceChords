        <h1>Savior of Peace</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">You are wearing robes of joy, our Savior and our peace
You are holy, full of beauty Jesus
Pouring out your life and blood, you were hung upon that cross
You are holy, full of beauty, Jesus

The heavens and the earth, will sing this song with joy
Before his feet, all will gather and will bow to worship you
The name of Jesus Christ, shines brightly like the sun
          D2                 A/C#                  D                  E                 (A)
all the glory, all the honor, to the Lamb upon the throne, eternally

     Open up heavens door, and shine your light
    Through the earth, salvation will be proclaimed</pre>
