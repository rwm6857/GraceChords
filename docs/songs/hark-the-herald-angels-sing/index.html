        <h1>Hark! The Herald Angels Sing</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Hark, the herald angels sing, glory to the new born King.
Peace on earth and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled.
Joyful all ye nations rise, join the trumpets of the skies,

With angelic hosts proclaim, Christ is born in Bethlehem,
Hark, the herald angels sing, glory to the new born King.

Christ by highest heaven adored, Christ the everlasting Lord.
Late in time behold Him come, offspring of a virgin's womb
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see, hail the incarnate DeF]ity.

Pleased as man with man to dwell, Jesus our Emmanuel,
Hark, the herald angels sing, glory to the new born King.

Hail the heaven born Prince of peace, hail the Son of righteousness,
Light and life to all He brings, risen with healing in His wings.
Mild He lays His glory by, born that man no more may die,

Born to raise the sons of earth, born to give them second birth,
Hark, the herald angels sing, glory to the new born King.</pre>
