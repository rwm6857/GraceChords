        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Rise and shout freedom to all the earth
Resound this land with the trumpet
Proclaim the kingdom of God is near
All people shall hear let it be known
All nations shall hear let it be known (second time)

Come, return to the land that I promised you
By the freedom bestowed on you
Keep my word, obey my will and
Forever enter in my rest

Set your brother free from captivity
Wounded and broken hearted
As I wipe away tears, stand firm and
Declare that my freedom is here

Lift your praises in offering sacrifice
leave the plow in your hand behind
Take and receive, you will eat from my harvest
Abundant and vast in my land

I'm the Lord, your Holy God
I will give you the land that I promised
I’m the Lord Jehovah
I am your Faithful God until the end</pre>
