        <h1>I Pledge Allegiance to the Lamb</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">I have heard how Christians long ago
Were brought before a tyrants throne
They were told that he would spare their lives
If they would renounce the name of Christ

But one by one they began to confess
Jesus Christ is my only Lord and King
Every fear entrusted to our God
With  we'll follow the way  the Lord

I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
With all my strength, with all I am
I will seek to honor His commands
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb

For this call of Jesus we've received
For his mission we will give our lives
And now our time has come to count the cost
To reject this world, to embrace the cross

And one by one let us live our lives
For the one who died to give us life
'Till the trumpet sounds on the final day
Let us proudly stand and boldly say</pre>
