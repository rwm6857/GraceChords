        <h1>He Abides</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">I’m rejoicing night and day, as I walk the narrow way,
For the hand of God in all my life I see;
And the reason of my bliss, yes, the secret all is this:
That the Comforter abides with me.

He abides, he abides;
Hallelujah, he abides with me!
I’m rejoicing night and day
As I walk the narrow way,
For the Comforter abides with me.

Once my heart was full of sin, once I had no peace within,
Till I heard how Jesus died upon the tree;
Then I fell down at his feet, and there came a peace so sweet;
Now the Comforter abides with me.

He is with me everywhere, and he knows my every care;
I’m as happy as a bird and just as free;
For the Spirit has control; Jesus satisfies my soul,
Since the Comforter abides with me.

There’s no thirsting for the things, of the world, they’ve taken wings;
Long ago I gave them up, and instantly
All my night was turned to day, all my burdens rolled away;
Now the Comforter abides with me.</pre>
