        <h1>Calling</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Jesus you walked on a lonely road, you bore every sin and shame
How you shed your blood upon the cross, down that path I also will go

Though suffering comes I will follow you
Through seas and mountains I will follow you
For the lost and broken to return, I will gladly lay down my life

Father God, I cry: “Would you send me?
I will run to where you lead
My whole life I give it all to you
Would you send me, my Lord

Though this world will hate me for your name
I will love them as you do
To save the world you died upon that cross
I will follow you Lord

To the point of laying down your life,
You displayed your love for us
Would you take my life and make it yours
For I love you my Lord</pre>
