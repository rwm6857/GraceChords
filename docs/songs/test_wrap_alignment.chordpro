Verse
This is a [G]very long lyric line with chords [C]placed deliberately near the boundary of where the line [D]will wrap to validate precise alignment
And here is [G]another test line that [C]also includes chords around the [D]wrap point for mapping checks

Chorus
[G]Wrap it [C]cleanly [D]line by line
[G]Keep the [C]chords in [D]perfect time
