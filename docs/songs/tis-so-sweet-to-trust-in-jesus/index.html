        <h1>‘Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">‘Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
And to take him at his word
Just to rest upon his promise,
And to know, "Thus saith the Lord."

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him! How I've proved him o'er and o'er!
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! O for grace to trust him more!

O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to trust his cleansing blood
And in simple faith to plunge me
Neath the healing, cleansing flood!

Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just from sin and self to cease
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest, and joy and peace.</pre>
