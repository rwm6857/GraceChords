        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Amazing grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now I’m found,
Was blind, but now I see.

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears released.
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed.

When we've been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when did when we first begun.

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now I’m found,
Was blind, but now I see.</pre>
