        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">As we seek the face of Jesus Christ
In worship Lord, Your people will arise
We live for the Lord and we die for the Lord
This is His calling for our lives

We follow Him, not the we can live
We follow Him, so that we may die
I lay down all I have, give it all to you Lord
So take my life, and let Your will be done

Lord give us revival once again
We seek the day of Your Kingdom coming again
Let us see that day of glory come
The glory of our Lord Jesus

On that glorious day, His people will arise
The church of Jesus Christ, will cover all the earth
Every nation bow and kneel before the Lord
Exalt His holy name</pre>
