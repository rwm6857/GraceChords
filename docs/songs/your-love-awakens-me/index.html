        <h1>Your Love Awakens Me</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">There were walls between us
By the Cross You came and
broke them down, You broke them down
There were chains around us
By Your grace we are no longer bound
No longer bound

Pre-Chorus
You called me out of the grave
You called me into the light
You called my name, and then my heart came alive!

Your love is greater! Your love is stronger!
Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me!
Your love is greater! Your love is stronger!
Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me!

Feel the darkness shaking
All the dead are coming
back to life, back to life
Hear the song awaken all creation
singing we're alive, cause You're alive!

Pre-Chorus
You called me out of the grave
You called me into the light
You called my name, and then my heart came alive!

And what a love we found!
Death can't hold us down!
We shout it out,  "We're alive cause You're alive!"</pre>
