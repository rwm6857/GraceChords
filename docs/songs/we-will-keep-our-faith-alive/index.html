        <h1>We Will Keep Our Faith Alive</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Gathered here within this place, we can share in God’s redeeming grace
There’s no room for doubt or fear: we can feel his presence here
As we face each passing day we will serve and honor and obey
And if hope should start to dim, we will know our trust is in him

And we will keep our faith alive, God will always be our guide
Through the darkest night, we will see God’s light
(We will stand as one ‘til his work is done)
We will keep our faith alive!

We will live as God has planned, though at times we may not understand
Many things we may not see, but our faith will help us believe
From the word we learn the truth, through his love we all are born anew
With His help we will not fail, for we know our God will prevail

When we share the love he gives, all the world will know that we are his
In God’s name we stand as one, and through us, his work will be done
Through all trials and all pain, we will trust alone in Jesus’ name
In his name there’s victory, let us worship him eternally</pre>
