        <h1>Open Up the Doors of Heaven</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Open up the doors of heaven,
We're here to meet with you oh Lord
In this song God we ask, that you'd set your gaze
Keep the doors of heaven opened

We are asking for your presence,
Lord we are waiting for you here
This our prayer, our desire as a fragrant offering
Give us in return your presence

We ask for you to come, Lord come and dwell among us
Receive all of the glory, as we give you all our praise
The name of Jesus Christ, the only name that saves us,
Be praised above all others, as we lift your name on high</pre>
