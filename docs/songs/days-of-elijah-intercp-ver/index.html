        <h1>Days of Elijah (InterCP Ver.)</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">These are the days of Elijah,
Declaring the word of the Lord,
And these are the days
of Your servant, Moses,
Righteousness being restored

And though these are days of great trials,
Of famine and darkness and sword,
Still, we are the voice in the desert crying,
“Prepare ye the way of the Lord!”

Behold He comes, riding on the clouds,
Shining like the sun, at the trumpet call
So lift your voice, it’s the year of Jubilee,
And out of Zion’s hill, Salvation comes

And these are the days of Ezekiel,
The dry bones becoming as flesh
And these are the days
of Your servant, David,
Rebuilding the temple of praise

And these are the days of the harvest,
The fields are as white in the world
And we are the laborers in Your vineyard,
Declaring the word of the Lord!

All glory to Jesus who is to come
All glory to Jesus who is to come

Glory, glory, glory, glory
Glory, glory, glory, glory</pre>
