[VERSE]
[D]Through you the blind will see, through you the mute will sing,
[G]Through you the dead will rise, through you all hearts will praise,
[Bm7]Through you the darkness flees, through you my heart screams,
[D]I am free! I am free!

[CHORUS]
[D]I am free to run (I am free to run)
[G]I am free to dance (I am free to dance)
[Bm]I am free to live for you (I am free to live for you)
[D]I am free (I am free)
