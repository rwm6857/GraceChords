        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Father we ask that you would come, and shine your light and love on us
Renew our dry and weary hearts, with your new hope
We come to offer you our lives, and worship you as Lord and King
Reveal your pow’r among the lost, Save this nation

Glory and honor to Jesus, all of the earth, and nations
Lift up the name of Jesus, Give him the glory forever
Glory and honor to Jesus, all of the earth, and nations
Lift up the name of Jesus, Give him the glory forevermore</pre>
