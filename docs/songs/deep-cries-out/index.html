        <h1>Deep Cries Out</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">I've got a river of
Living water
A fountain that never will run dry
It's open heavens You're releasing
And we will never be denied

Cause we're stirring up deep deep wells,
We're stirring up deep deep waters
We're going to dance in the river, dance in the river
Cause we're stirring up deep deep wells,
We're stirring up deep deep waters
We're going to jump in the river,
Jump in the river

Deep cries out to deep cries out to You,
deep cries out to deep cries out to You
We cry out to, we cry out to, You Jesus

We're falling into deeper waters, calling out to You
We're walking into deeper waters, going after You</pre>
