        <h1>Christ be Magnified</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Were creation suddenly articulate
With a thousand tongues to lift one cry
Then from north to south and east to west
We'd hear "Christ be magnified!"

Were the whole earth echoing His eminence
His name would burst from sea and sky
From rivers to the mountaintops
We'd hear "Christ be magnified!"

O Christ be magnified
Let His praise arise
Christ be magnified in me
O Christ be magnified
From the altar of my life
Christ be magnified in me

When every creature finds its inmost melody
And every human heart its native cry
Oh then in one enraptured hymn of praise
We'll sing "Christ be magnified"

I won't bow to idols
I'll stand strong and worship You
If it puts me in the fire
I'll rejoice ‘cause You're there too

I won't be formed by feelings
I hold fast to what is true
If the cross brings transformation
Then I'll be crucified with You

'Cause death is just the doorway
Into resurrection life
If I join You in Your sufferings
Then I'll join You when You rise

And when You return in glory
With all the angels and the saints
My heart will still be singing
And my song will be the same</pre>
