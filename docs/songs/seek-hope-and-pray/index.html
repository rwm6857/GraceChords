        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Every moment that I live in this life
Lord I cannot trust in my own way and strength
I will not grow weary but I’ll kneel and pray
For my God, you are my life and my true hope

Father God, may your dream, be my only vision
Jesus as you came to serve, Lord I want to be like you
Holy Spirit may your power be my strength in every hour
This I seek, hope, and pray with all my heart

As I’m walking down this narrow path you walked
Lord I will not trust in what the world can give
I will not grow weary but I’ll worship you
For my God, you are my life and my true joy</pre>
