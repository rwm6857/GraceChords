        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">The church of God upon this land, arise and stand with the calling from above
With a voice that shouts into the wilderness, rise up again, burst forth into bloom
Holy Spirit, may this generation proclaim the truth of Jesus Christ our Lord
May the love he bore upon the cross become the love we bear in our hearts

Every door once shut, open in Jesus name
Every generation, awake and arise
Come kneel before our Lord Jesus and worship him alone
He has conquered death, the King of peace

Spirit of God, come upon us
With the power of the Spirit in the early church
Come awaken and raise up the church of God
Stand up and rise, shine your light
Lift high the flag of victory and march on forth
Prepare the way of our Lord</pre>
