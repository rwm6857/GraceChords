There's a place, where mercy reigns and never dies
There's a place, where streams of grace flows deep and wide

All the love, I've ever found
Comes like a flood, comes flowing down

At the cross, at the cross
I surrender my life
I'm in awe of you; I'm in awe of you
Where your love ran red, and my sins washed white
I owe all to you, I owe all to you
Jesus

There's a place, where sin and shame are powerless
Where my heart has peace with God, and forgiveness

All the love, I've ever found
Comes like a flood, comes flowing down

Here my hope is found, here on holy ground
Here I bow down, here I bow down
Here arms open wide, here you saved my life
Here I bow down, here I bow</pre>
