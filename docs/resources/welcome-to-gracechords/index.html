        <h1>Welcome to GraceChords!</h1>
        <pre class="gc-seo-lyrics">Hello, and welcome to GraceChords. This platform exists to serve churches with simple, accessible, and volunteer-focused worship resources. If you're a worship leader, worship team member, or home group that wants clean, easy-to-use lead sheets without complexity or paywalls -- you're in the right place.&amp;#x20;

Our goal is not replace existing worship/planning platforms, monetize, or become the anything huge. Instead, GraceChords is focused on one thing: helping Churches bring their congregations into the presence of God.

Where it Started

I'm Ryan, the lead-and-sole developer of GraceChords. On top of a full-time job, I serve a small church and juggle youth ministry, worship ministry, handling the AV, and a slew of other things. For the longest time, leading worship was something I put the least amount of time in preparing. At the time, I relied on a camera roll full of screenshots, sent them to the team over messages, and hoped everyone knew how to transpose and manage the chord sheets in my convoluted way. During one youth group, one of my students asked me to put together a community songbook with chord sheets we regularly use. With the fear of formatting, typing out every song, and keeping it updated, I wanted to find a way out. Instead, I found the starting point of my perfect solution: GraceChords. Armed with rusty JavaScript skills, a basic GitHub Pages setup, and a dream, I started to work on building a personal worship platform that suited my needs. Overtime, friends and coministers began to take interest and suggest features. Now, GraceChords has become a comprehensive, totally free project that is ever-changing in order to best serve the Kingdom of God.&amp;#x20;

Why GraceChords?

There are many powerful worship tools out there -- but power often comes with cost, complexity, or lock-in.&amp;#x20;

GraceChords was built with a different philosophy:

 Worship resources should be accessible, not gated behind paywalls
 Songs should serve congregations, not performances
 Tools should reduce friction, not induce headaches
 Churches should focus on God, not systems that require a degree to understand

What You'll Find Here

 Save and share links to sets with your team
 Create custom, printable songbooks with automatic numbering, table of contents, and custom covers

3) Service-Friendly Views

4) Exportable &amp; Shareable Charts

For those who prefer paper over digital, GraceChords is here for you, too! GraceChords supports exporting PDF/JPG songs, setlists, and songbooks for multi-modal usability and share-ability.

Who is GraceChords For?

GraceChords is especially built for volunteer worship teams, bi-vocational ministers, small/mid-sized churches lacking full-time tech staff, and leaders who value simplicity in praise. If your goal is to help people worship God -- not impress them -- this platform was built with you in mind.

The Heart Behind the Project&amp;#x20;

GraceChords is a ministry-minded project. That means:

 Theology matters.
 Simplicity matters.
 Faith matters.
 People matter.

Every feature is built with the questions: "Does this help the Church worship more deeply, freely, and faithfully?"

If you're new, browser the library, try making a setlist, use the tools for rehearsal or service, and explore the various resources created for worship leaders. And if you find GraceChords helpful -- share it freely. GraceChords is still growing, and I'm grateful you're here. May this tool serve you as you serve the Church.</pre>
